# How does it work?
You may check our Telegram channel at @BestTraderrs for free trading signals (A proof of our work) or @AmirRX_Trader for subscription of our TraderBot which uses our Telegram Channel Signals by default, eventhough you can define your own strategies using the bot which will create a new way to trade the market, and all the bot will do is scan the market for your strategy and then manage your position and risk when an entry is found.
# TO-DO List
- Add new strategies as code examples along with ready to use codes
- Add TrendLine capability
- Add Pitchforks capability (Andrew's + Schiff's)
- Add LOOPs to the language
- Add position management customizations for scripts
- Add config managements through scripting
- Add more indicators (Stochastic etc)
- Create dynamic alerts to be able to add dynamic data into alert text
- Add channel strategies (not their code) for intraction and customizations


# Known Issues
- Global data is not per asset but used for all assets which means using same variable name on a ALL strategy type will result in wrong calculations and signals
- If you use strategy type ALL then translation script for strategy adding will take too long
